    "Supervised Learning is the process of learning based on known examples which have both an input and a labeled output. Using the data and labels provided in the training dataset, models can learn a prediction function or mapping, which may then be applied to unseen test data. As we discussed in the class, some common methods for supervised learning include the K-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier (KNN) and Naive Bayes."
